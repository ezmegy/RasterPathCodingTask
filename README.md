# RasterPathCodingTask
A small program calculating pixels of a path using Midpoint Line alg.

Example problem:
There is a 128x128 pixel terrain grid onto which we wish to draw a path texture. 
The user will select a start and end point and a path that is 4 pixels wide should appear on the terrain in a straight line between those two points. 
Tak the start and end points from the user. 
Using those points and the path width, determine which terrain pixels should get the new path texture.

Input:
Initialise input from the terminal. 
You can choose to input all the data manually or to enter absolute path to an input file containing the data.

Output:
Results will be printed to terminal and you also have to enter a path to valid file or directory to write the results into.
